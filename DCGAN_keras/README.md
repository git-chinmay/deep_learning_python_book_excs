# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Neural Network

This is a simple low performing GAN implementaion using keras. The training set is the 5000 images from CIFAR10 dataset. We are using only one class(frog) out of 10 classes.

As its simplified model hence the performance is not good. The first few generated images are only random coloured dots and then it becomes black and finally white. Its not matching with the original image at all at current state.

We can train with different learning rate and iteration count as a start.
